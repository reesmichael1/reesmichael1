I have worked at all levels of the tech stack, spanning from raw assembly to web services. I particularly enjoy systems programming and adjacent topics. 

Some of my favorite projects include:

- [Burro](https://github.com/reesmichael1/burro), a new typesetting language
- [revocatio](https://github.com/reesmichael1/revocatio), a health monitor for your backups 
- [WebWhir](https://github.com/reesmichael1/2webshir), an HTML rendering engine

I started my career working as a software developer at [Saracen Energy](https://saracenenergy.com) and at Ibira Capital Managemnet. I also worked as a professional organist at one of the largest music programs in the United States for several years. Following my time in music, I've most recently done a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com).
